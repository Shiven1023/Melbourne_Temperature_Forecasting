> ⚠️ **This project is currently under active development and is not yet complete.**

## Project Overview
Comparing multiple forecasting techniques on the Melbourne daily minimum 
temperature dataset (1981-1990) to gain insights into their respective 
strengths and weaknesses.

## Models to be Compared
- [ ] Naive Forecasting
- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] ARIMA/SARIMA
- [ ] Simple RNN
